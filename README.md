## Development Environment Setup

This project contains both backend and frontend applications.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Add and .env in the back directory with these variables for your MongoDB:
  DB_USER
  DB_PASSWORD
  DB_HOST
  DB_NAME

### Install dependencies

From the root directory, run:

```
npm install
```

This will install the root development dependencies. You should also install dependencies in the `back` and `front` folders:

```
cd back && npm install
cd ../front && npm install
```

### Run backend and frontend

From the root directory, simply run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend and frontend development servers concurrently.
